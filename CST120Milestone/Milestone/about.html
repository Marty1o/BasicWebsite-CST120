        <h2 >About me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello all, my name is Martin but you can call me Marty! I am 26 years old and currently live
            in
            Arizona, USA.
            I am currently attending GCU for Software Development. <br /> I currently work an a Fraud Analyst but
            once I
            graduate I plan to work in Tech.
        </p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>

        <p>My hobby is going to the gym, I love to working out. When I was a kid, I was not in the best of shape and
            stayed indoors a lot.
            Now I am a adult and have a lot more control over my life and choices. For this reason I try to stay
            active
            and take the time
            to go out and get my blood flowing. Its also a great way to clear my mind and get rid of stress.

            Whenever I am having a hard time I head to the gym and let that fuel my training. This however is not
            the
            only hobby I have and below is a
            list of some of the things that I like to do when I have extra time.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Going to Gym</li>
            <li>Going out with friends</li>
            <li>Learning new languages</li>
            <li>Going to the Movies</li>
            <li>Playing Card Games</li>

        </ol>

        </h2>
        <p>
            I am currently attending GCU for a Bachelors Degree in Software Development. I am going
            this
            fully online since I also have a full time job.
            Going to school full time on campus is not possible for this reason and this program being fully
            online
            has
            been a life saver. I am not about
            8 months from graduating with my expected graduation date set to around 06/2023. This whole process
            has
            been
            a rollercoaster but I have stayed
            for the ride so far and cannot wait to reap the benefits when I am finally done.
